# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

# 0. Factorize all the things!

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

Usage: factors where is a file containing natural numbers to factor. One number per line You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1 You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number The file will always end with a new line Output format: n=p*q one factorization per line p and q don’t have to be prime numbers See example You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn’t finish Push all your scripts, source code, etc… to your repository we will only run your executable factors

1. RSA Factoring Challenge
RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers.
The task is automatically killed in 5 seconds.
